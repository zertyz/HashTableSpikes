# HashTableSpikes
Inquisitive software to explore different aspects of various hash tables &amp; maps implementations.

Aspects, such as the following ones, are addressed:

- How reentrant they are and where to place mutexes;
- How fast they are, both mono and multithread;
- How much hungry they are for memory.

Please see 'CMakeLists.txt' for instructions on how to build.

Note: this project depends, among others, on some Mutua's libraries:

- CppUtils
- SplitRun
- AlgorithmComplexityAndReentrancyAnalysis
